* What is?
A Nicktoons: Unite! level parser written in lua

Somewhat hacky...
I honestly just wanted to get the job done of viewing levels.
I'll probably make a cleaner implementation in a different lang.

* How do?
you'll need AwesomeWM/oocairo, plus luafilesystem
should just run then...it should put the maps into out/

* Future plans?
spec.org might have them
I can't draw the level geometry, even if I really want to
If anyone can tell me what format the .ini's are, that would rock.
